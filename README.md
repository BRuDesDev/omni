# Omni

Omni is a custom, Raspberry Pi–based AI assistant crafted for personal use and convenience. By leveraging voice activation (“Hey Omni”), it captures audio input, converts it to text, and processes requests through a GPT-based model to provide intelligent, context-aware responses. Results are then relayed back through text-to-speech (Amazon Polly), creating a fully integrated voice assistant solution.

Beyond basic voice interactions, Omni’s extensible architecture supports advanced use cases including:

    Network Monitoring and Intrusion Detection (IDS) for home networks

    Camera-based security integration

    IoT device management and control

A 5×7” screen can be connected to the Raspberry Pi to display custom images, animations, or other dynamic content based on user interactions. As the project evolves, new features and capabilities will be integrated to further enhance functionality and user experience.

This repository provides an overview of the software stack, including:

    Speech Recognition for hotword detection and input capture

    Natural Language Processing leveraging GPT-based models

    Text-to-Speech output using Amazon Polly

    Future Enhancements for camera feeds, network insights, and IoT integration

Contributions and suggestions are welcome, though the project is primarily tailored for a highly customized personal environment. For questions or improvements, please submit an issue or open a pull request. ☝️❤️
